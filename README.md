<h1>Web Application using Flask</h1>
<p>I've always wanted to make develop a website on my own, and I also wanted to learn python. That's where I stumbled upon this micro-framework
flask, and I saw it as a good opportunity to develop my skills</p>
<p>This is a very simple version of twitter, where users can create their accounts, and post anything they like. You can browse anyone's tweets,
You could also customize your profile, namely changing your name, email or your profile picture. I had fun making developing this 
web-application, and the process was made even easier by a youtuber, named Corey Schafuer<p>
I'm hoping to develop more such applications by myself in future!<p>
